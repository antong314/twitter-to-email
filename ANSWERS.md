### Email Format & Content

1. **Tweet grouping preference**: Do you want tweets **grouped by author** (all tweets from @user1, then all from @user2, etc.) or a **flat chronological timeline** (newest first across all accounts)?
Answer: group by author

2. **Include replies & retweets?** The plan mentions including them – do you want:
   - Original tweets only
   - Original tweets + replies by that person
   - Everything (originals + replies + retweets/quote tweets)
   Answer: - Original tweets + replies by that person

3. **Media in emails**: Should the digest include embedded images/video thumbnails, or just text + links?
Answer: include media

### Email Delivery

4. **Email provider**: Which do you prefer?
   - **Resend.com** (recommended, easiest setup, free tier)
   - **Gmail SMTP** with app password
   - Other (SendGrid, Postmark, etc.)
Answer: Resend.com

5. **Sender address**: Do you have a custom domain, or will you send from something like `yourname@gmail.com`?
Whatever is easiest to set-up. I have a personal gmail account that I can use.  I also have some domains I can probably set-up if needed.
